1) Write an Algorithm and draw a flow chart to find factorial of the given number(Method2)?
                                  n=5  ==>  5X4X3X2X1 = 120
 
2) Write an Algorithm and draw a flow chart to check the given number is palindrome number or not?
                                    n=121  ----> Palindrome Number                                                     
                                    n=123  -----> Not Palidrome Number
 
3) Write an Algorithm and draw a flow chart to check the given number is Armstrong number or not?
                                  n=153
                                       3X3X3= 27
                                       5X5X5=125
                                       1X1X1=1
                                                    ---
                                                    153  
4) Write an Algorithm and draw a flow chart to print the reverse of the given number ?
                                         n=1234 -------> 4321
5) Write an Algorithm and draw a flow chart to fint the sum of digits?
