<p>When you load a webpage, images should pop up quickly. <br>Humans are visual creatures and we like to view webpages with colorful images. They draw our eye and our attention. 

Those images are prompted by image tags, a type of code that tells the websiteâ€™s server where to find the images, how to load them, and what to do with them once they have been loaded.

<br>Image tags are instructions on how to display an image, as images are not actually embedded into a page.<br> Images are files that are fetched and displayed on the page depending on the code or image tag used. The code can change the attributes or the functionality of the image when it loads.</p>
